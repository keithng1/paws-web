      <hr><br>
   
      <p>Membership in PAASCU:</p>
      
      
      <p>An institution or program seeking accreditation status from PAASCU must complete six (6) major steps in the accreditation process. These steps are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The Institutional Self-Survey</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This first step of the process is a thorough, rigorous, and comprehensive self-assessment of the institution’s educational resources and effectiveness made by in-house members of the school. Such an institutional survey of self-evaluation is a major enterprise that takes at least six (6) months to complete. With the use of the self-survey forms, members of area committees appointed by administration conduct a fair and objective assessment of how well the institution has achieved its philosophy and objectives for the purpose of self-improvement.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The self-study also documents how the institution of program meets the standards of PAASCU. The results of the institution’s self-assessment are thereafter presented to PAASCU in the Self-Survey Report which records and describes the salient features that surfaced from said self-assessment. This Self-Survey Report together with certain specified institutional materials such as the college catalog and manuals, completed data forms, among others, serve as basis for evaluation by an on-site team of peer evaluators, who are administrators and faculty from other accredited colleges and universities.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">It must be noted that compliance with PAASCU criteria, standards and requirements is essential for gaining and maintaining accreditation with PAASCU. The requirements establish a level of development required of an institution or program seeking initial or continued accreditation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">2. 

<p style="text-align:justify">A school applying for a Preliminary Survey is not placed on the visit-ready list until PAASCU has sent a consultant to review the school’s application and insitutional self-study survey report. The consultant’s task is to assist the applicant school in properly accomplishing the survey forms and in determining whether or not the school has complied with PAASCU requirements and standards. The consultant also assists the school in identifying the documents that should be prepared and exhibited for the Visiting Team. Based on the consultant’s assessment, he or she then informs PAASCU of the earliest time the school can be visited by the survey team for a Preliminary Survey.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">3. The Pre-Survey (Preliminary) Visit</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">In this step, a group of five (5) to eight (8) academics specially trained as accreditors and with the expertise in the program or programs to be evaluated visits the school. Typically lasting two (2) days and following PAASCU procedures, the on-site evaluation seeks to assess the school in light of the self survey based on the standards for accreditation. This Pre-Survey Team takes a general look at the school situation, validates the Self-Survey through interviews with school members and examination of school documents/exhibits on-site, studies the recommendations presented in the Self-Survey Report, cites what it finds to have the best features of the different areas and makes recommendations of its own when necessary. Once a school or program is judged ready for a Formal Survey Visit, it is granted “Candidate” status for a two (2)-year period. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify">4. The Formal Survey Visit</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Formal Survey Visit is conducted by a team of six (6) to eight (8) accreditors not earlier than six (6) months after the Pre-Survey (Preliminary) Visit. The Visit usually lasts for two (2) days and follows the same process of interviewing school members and examining school documents/exhibits. The accreditors, however, now cite the action taken by the school on the recommendations given by the Preliminary Survey Team. As in the Pre-Survey Visit, the team also identifies the areas’ best features and makes its own recommendations where necessary. A school or program granted formal accreditation is given Level I accredited status for a period of three (3) years.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">5. Initial Accreditation Status Granted</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Upon favorable evaluation and recommendation by the Formal Survey Team, the PAASCU Board of Directions grants initial accreditation for a period of three (3) years. Accreditation indicates overall excellence in the delivery of programs and services and that the program or institution has no major deficiencies that compromise its educational effectiveness. With this initial accreditation, the institution becomes a full member of PAASCU.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">6. Full Accreditation Status Granted</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">After the three (3)-year period, the institution/program undertakes another institutional self-evaluation and is visited by a Re-Survey Team. A favorable re-evaluation after the initial 3-year accreditation period merits for the institution/program full accreditation for a period of five (5) years. Full accreditation indicates optimal compliance with PAASCU criteria/standards and demonstrates the institution’s/program’s overall excellence in the delivery of programs and services. The institution or program is also granted Level II re-accredited status at this time.</p>
