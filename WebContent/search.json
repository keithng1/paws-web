	  "content": "Membership in PAASCU: An institution or program seeking accreditation status from PAASCU must complete six (6) major steps in the accreditation process. These steps are as follows: 1. The Institutional Self-Survey This first step of the process is a thorough, rigorous, and comprehensive self-assessment of the institution’s educational resources and effectiveness made by in-house members of the school. Such an institutional survey of self-evaluation is a major enterprise that takes at least six (6) months to complete. With the use of the self-survey forms, members of area committees appointed by administration conduct a fair and objective assessment of how well the institution has achieved its philosophy and objectives for the purpose of self-improvement. The self-study also documents how the institution of program meets the standards of PAASCU. The results of the institution’s self-assessment are thereafter presented to PAASCU in the Self-Survey Report which records and describes the salient features that surfaced from said self-assessment. This Self-Survey Report together with certain specified institutional materials such as the college catalog and manuals, completed data forms, among others, serve as basis for evaluation by an on-site team of peer evaluators, who are administrators and faculty from other accredited colleges and universities. It must be noted that compliance with PAASCU criteria, standards and requirements is essential for gaining and maintaining accreditation with PAASCU. The requirements establish a level of development required of an institution or program seeking initial or continued accreditation. 2. A school applying for a Preliminary Survey is not placed on the visit-ready list until PAASCU has sent a consultant to review the school’s application and insitutional self-study survey report. The consultant’s task is to assist the applicant school in properly accomplishing the survey forms and in determining whether or not the school has complied with PAASCU requirements and standards. The consultant also assists the school in identifying the documents that should be prepared and exhibited for the Visiting Team. Based on the consultant’s assessment, he or she then informs PAASCU of the earliest time the school can be visited by the survey team for a Preliminary Survey. 3. The Pre-Survey (Preliminary) Visit In this step, a group of five (5) to eight (8) academics specially trained as accreditors and with the expertise in the program or programs to be evaluated visits the school. Typically lasting two (2) days and following PAASCU procedures, the on-site evaluation seeks to assess the school in light of the self survey based on the standards for accreditation. This Pre-Survey Team takes a general look at the school situation, validates the Self-Survey through interviews with school members and examination of school documents/exhibits on-site, studies the recommendations presented in the Self-Survey Report, cites what it finds to have the best features of the different areas and makes recommendations of its own when necessary. Once a school or program is judged ready for a Formal Survey Visit, it is granted “Candidate” status for a two (2)-year period. 4. The Formal Survey Visit The Formal Survey Visit is conducted by a team of six (6) to eight (8) accreditors not earlier than six (6) months after the Pre-Survey (Preliminary) Visit. The Visit usually lasts for two (2) days and follows the same process of interviewing school members and examining school documents/exhibits. The accreditors, however, now cite the action taken by the school on the recommendations given by the Preliminary Survey Team. As in the Pre-Survey Visit, the team also identifies the areas’ best features and makes its own recommendations where necessary. A school or program granted formal accreditation is given Level I accredited status for a period of three (3) years. 5. Initial Accreditation Status Granted Upon favorable evaluation and recommendation by the Formal Survey Team, the PAASCU Board of Directions grants initial accreditation for a period of three (3) years. Accreditation indicates overall excellence in the delivery of programs and services and that the program or institution has no major deficiencies that compromise its educational effectiveness. With this initial accreditation, the institution becomes a full member of PAASCU. 6. Full Accreditation Status Granted After the three (3)-year period, the institution/program undertakes another institutional self-evaluation and is visited by a Re-Survey Team. A favorable re-evaluation after the initial 3-year accreditation period merits for the institution/program full accreditation for a period of five (5) years. Full accreditation indicates optimal compliance with PAASCU criteria/standards and demonstrates the institution’s/program’s overall excellence in the delivery of programs and services. The institution or program is also granted Level II re-accredited status at this time."

	  "content": "PAASCU stands for Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities. It is a private, voluntary, non-profit and non- stock corporation which was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 5, 1957. PAASCU is a service organization that accredits academic programs which meet standards of quality education. In November 1967, the Bureau of Education and Culture (now the Department of Education) officially recognized PAASCU and endorsed its work as an accrediting agency. PAASCU is also one of the three founding members of the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP), which was established in 1977 and is authorized by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) to certify the levels of accredited programs for the purpose of granting progressive deregulation and other benefits. PAASCU has been a full member of the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE). As of 2005, INQAAHE is composed of 150 accrediting agencies coming from over 60 different countries. These agencies have also created regional networks, one of which is the Asia-PAcific Quality Network (APQN), with PAASCU being one of its active members. PAASCU also has linkages with the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA), which is a private, nonprofit national organization that coordinates accreditation activity in the United States, as well as with the National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (NCFMEA), which is based in Washington, D.C. PAASCU’s objectives are as follows: To stimulate and integrate the efforts of institutions to elevate the standards of education in the Philippines. To strengthen the capabilities of educational institutions for service to the nation.To identify educational institutions which meet or exceed stated criteria of educational quality. To encourage and assist institutions which have the potential and interest to improve themselves through continuing evaluation and self-surveys. To provide counsel and assistance to established and developing institutions and programs. To provide a basis for institutional relationships, particularly in the transfer of students. To provide guidance to students and parents in the choice of institutions and programs. To attract financial aid from government and other sources for accredited programs and schools applying for accreditation. To assist schools in their quest for regional and international recognition of their academic programs. To network with national and international organization involved in quality assurance."

	  "href": "Accreditation",
	  "title": "What is Accreditation?",
	  "content": "A concept based on self-regulation which focuses on evaluation and the continuing improvement of educational quality. A process by which institutions or programs continuously upgrade their educational quality and services through self-evaluation and the judgment of peers A status granted to an educational institution or program which meets commonly accepted standards of quality or excellence. The basic characteristics of accreditation are: Its prevailing sense of volunteerism; its strong tradition of self-regulation; its reliance on evaluation techniques; its primary concern with quality. Why Private, Voluntary Accreditation? In general, all educational institutions in the Philippines go through one form of accreditation – “recognized by the government.” Government recognition is, however, inadequate for purposes of identifying and determining educational quality. Thus, private voluntary accreditation provides the opportunity for an educational institution to attain standards above those prescribed as minimum requirements by the government."

The statements in the survey forms are more qualitative rather than quantitative. The Association does not have specific formulas to apply or particular patterns of organization to follow. The criteria and survey instruments are merely tools to help the school measure educational quality. They are intended to serve as a guide for institutions as they strive for excellence and for accreditors as they assess institutional achievement. The standards reflect a realistic appraisal of the school’s resources and their efficient utilization to help the institution achieve its goals."
